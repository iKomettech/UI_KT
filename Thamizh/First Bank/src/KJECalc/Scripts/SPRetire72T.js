usted reciba Pagos Peri&oacute;dicos y B&aacute;sicamente Iguales (PPBI) basados en su expectativa de la vida. La cantidad del pago debe ser calculada usando uno de los m&eacute;todos aprobados por el IRS que incluyen:<p> <UL> <li><strong>El m&eacute;todo de la expectativa de vida:</strong> Este es el m&eacute;todo m&aacute;s sencillo para calcular sus PPBI, pero este tambi&eacute;n produce el pago m&aacute;s bajo. Toma simplemente su balance actual y lo divide por su expectativa de vida o expectativa de vida mancomunada.<p> <li><strong>Amortizada durante su expectativa de vida:</strong> Con este m&eacute;todo, la cantidad para ser distribuida anualmente es determinada amortizando su balance de cuenta sobre su expectativa de vida o la expectativa de vida mancomunada. <p> <li><strong>Seguro de renta durante su expectativa de vida: </strong>Este m&eacute;todo usa un factor de anualidad para calcular su PPBI. Esto es uno de los m&eacute;todos m&aacute;s complejos y produce casi el mismo resultado que el m&eacute;todo amortizado. El IRS lo explica de la siguiente manera; se toma el balance de cuenta del contribuyente y se divide por un factor de anualidad igual al valor presente de un seguro de renta de $1 por mes comenzando a la edad del contribuyente en el primer a&ntilde;o de distribuci&oacute;n y continuando por el resto de su vida. Por ejemplo miremos a una persona que tiene 50 a&ntilde;os de edad y $100,000 de balance de cuenta: Su factor de una anualidad de $1 por a&ntilde;o ser&iacute;a 11.109 (asumiendo una tasa de inter&eacute;s de 8 por ciento). Dicha persona recibir&iacute;a una distribuci&oacute;n anual de $9,002 ($100,000/11.109 = $9,002). Esta calculadora usa la Tabla de Mortalidad UP -1984, la cual no se basa en el sexo de las personas y es aceptada por el IRS. Por favor note que su PPSI es calculado a base de un Seguro de Renta y se basa en su expectativa de vida solamente, y no en la edad de su beneficiario. <p> </UL></dd></div> <div id='KJE-D-ACCOUNT_BALANCE' ><dt>Balance de Cuenta</dt><dd>Este es el balance de su cuenta al final del d&iacute;a h&aacute;bil del 31 de diciembre del a&ntilde;o anterior Este balance es usado por las distribuciones 72T con una excepci&oacute;n importante: Dicho balance aumenta por cualquier contribuci&oacute;n hecha despu&eacute;s del 31 de diciembre el a&ntilde;o anterior.</dd></div> <div id='KJE-D-YOUR_AGE' ><dt>Su edad</dt><dd>Esta es su edad actual.
