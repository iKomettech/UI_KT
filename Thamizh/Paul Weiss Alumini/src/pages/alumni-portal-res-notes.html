            <ul>
                <li><b>DON WALLACE</b> (1957–1958; 1960–1962) continues to serve as chairman of the International Law
                    Institute
                    and as a Georgetown law professor. He always thinks fondly of the firm.</li>
                <li><b>DUNCAN CAMERON</b> (1959–1962) has retired from the practice of law, and occasionally provides
                    legal
                    advice. He values the time that he spent at Paul, Weiss and the good training that he received.
                    Duncan still lives in Washington and vacations every summer in the Adirondacks.</li>
                <li><b>BERNIE FILLER</b> (1962–1969) became executive vice president and a director of Storm Drilling
                    and
                    Marine following his tenure at Paul, Weiss. After Storm Drilling’s acquisition by a larger
                    competitor, Bernie was briefly a partner of a Chicago-based law firm where he headed the corporate
                    department. Then, he served as chief executive officer and managing general partner for nine years
                    over 23 private investment partnerships. Today, Bernie is an independent investment banker for his
                    Chicago-based firm, Lidemara Enterprises LLC. A distinguishing aspect of his professional career is
                    that for the past 12 years, he has traveled to China several times and has been active in creating
                    cross-border relationships between China and North America. Bernie has three children and eight
                    grandchildren, as well as three great grandchildren who were born in the past five months.</li>
                <li><b>JEREMIAH GINSBERG</b> (Entertainment, 1963–1964) is a musical writer and producer whose very own
                    musical
                    Mendel’s Messiah is in pre-production for a motion picture. He composed and orchestrated the music,
                    wrote the lyrics, co-wrote the book and produced the show with his beautiful wife, Wendy, through
                    their company, Jeremiah Theatricals. The show won a Bronze Halo Award from The Southern California
                    Motion Picture Council in 1981, was produced off-Broadway at The Perry Street Theatre in 1985 and,
                    most recently, was produced in a concert version production in Washington, D.C. in 2022. They are
                    excited to be preparing a screenplay for the motion picture.</li>
                <li><b>STEPHEN GILLERS</b> (1969–1971) finished the 13th edition of his legal ethics casebook,
                    Regulation of
                    Lawyers: Problems of Law and Ethics (Aspen), to be published in March 2024. He wrote a law review
                    article identifying how the Department of Justice can be protected from an abusive president,
                    Because They Are Lawyers First and Foremost: “Ethics, Rules and Other Strategies to Protect the
                    Justice Department From a Faithless President,” 57 Georgia Law Review 163 (2022). Stephen became
                    emeritus at New York University Law School and continues to teach professional responsibility there
                    each semester. For the last 25 years, he’s been giving five legal ethics CLE lectures yearly at the
