<p>If you sent money to the wrong person, we recommend contacting the recipient and requesting the money back. If you aren’t able to get your money back, please call customer services at <a href="tel:(855)322-6736">855-FCB-OPEN</a> so we can help you.</p>
<p>Scheduled and recurring payments are not sent with <em>Zelle</em>. You can cancel a payment that is scheduled in advance if the money has not already been deducted from your account.</p>
