                            <p>On April 17, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Title VII of the Civil Rights
                                Act does not require employees to suffer a “‘significant’ employment disadvantage” in
                                order to state a viable discrimination claim.[1]  Rather, to prevail under Title VII, an
                                employee must demonstrate “some harm respecting an identifiable term or condition of
                                employment.”[2]  This decision resolves a circuit split[3] on the standard for Title VII
                                claims and potentially allows for more workplace discrimination lawsuits to proceed to
                                trial.</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>

                    <p class="rpara">In Muldrow v. City of St. Louis[4] a police officer sued the St. Louis Police
                        Department for
                        gender-based discrimination under Title VII.  She alleged that her transfer to a different
                        position resulted in diminished prestige and benefits.  Although Muldrow retained her rank and
                        salary, her new role involved more administrative duties.  She also was excluded from working on
                        priority cases with high-ranking officials, lost access to her take-home vehicle, was assigned
                        to inconsistent schedules that included weekends, and was stripped of special FBI privileges
                        that previously allowed her to earn up to $17,500 in overtime annually.[5]</p>
                    <p class="rpara">When Muldrow filed her lawsuit, federal courts were divided on the standard for a
                        viable Title
                        VII claim challenging an allegedly discriminatory transfer.[6]  The statute forbids employees
                        from “discriminat[ing] against any individual with respect to his [or her] compensation, terms,
                        conditions, or privileges of employment” based on certain protected categories.[7]  Some courts,
                        such as the First, Second, and Seventh Circuits, had interpreted this language to require the
                        alleged discrimination to have caused a “materially significant disadvantage”; while others,
                        such as the Fifth and D.C. Circuits, did not.[8]</p>
                    <p>Siding with the former, the district court and the Eighth Circuit dismissed Muldrow’s claim,
                        finding that she had failed to show that her transfer resulted in a “materially significant
                        disadvantage.”[9]  While the transfer changed some of her job responsibilities, there was no
                        “diminution to her title, salary, or benefits.”  Thus, the Eighth Circuit reasoned, plaintiff’s
                        injuries were “insufficient” to establish a viable Title VII claim.[10]</p>
                    <div class="collapsePanel" style="display:none">
                        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
                        <p>On April 15, the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) announced a
                            Pilot Program on Voluntary Self-Disclosure for Individuals (the “VSD Pilot Program” or the
                            “Program”).[1]&nbsp; The VSD Pilot Program offers non-prosecution agreements (“NPAs”)[2] to
                            qualifying individuals who proactively provide original information to the Criminal Division
                            concerning certain specified types of corporate criminal misconduct.</p>
                        <p>This marks the first time a DOJ program has explicitly offered to forego prosecution of an
                            individual in exchange for their cooperation against a company.&nbsp; Although the Program
                            applies broadly to misconduct by any public or private company, the Program appears focused
                            on misconduct by banks, investment funds and health care providers, and on violations of the
                            Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act,<a name="_ftnref3"
                                href="#_ftn3"><span>[3]</span></a> the money laundering statutes, as well as fraud in
                            connection with government contracting and the payment of bribes or kickbacks to domestic
                            public officials.</p>
                        <p>DOJ has adopted a number of programs aimed at promoting whistleblower complaints and
                            corporate voluntary self-disclosures.<a name="_ftnref4"
                                href="#_ftn4"><span>[4]</span></a>&nbsp; The VSD Pilot Program continues DOJ’s focus on
                            corporate criminal enforcement and underscores its efforts to, as Deputy Attorney General
                            Lisa Monaco stated last month, “create new incentives for individuals to report misconduct”
                            to DOJ and “drive companies to invest further in their own internal compliance and reporting
                            systems.”<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5"><span>[5]</span></a> &nbsp;At that time, DOJ
                            commenced a “90-day sprint” to develop a whistleblower program that will provide financial
                            incentives to individuals “<em>not</em> involved in the criminal activity itself” to provide
                            tips on an array of criminal activity.<a name="_ftnref6"
                                href="#_ftn6"><span>[6]</span></a>&nbsp; The VSD Pilot Program complements the
                            whistleblower program by offering an incentive for qualifying individuals who <em>are</em>
                            involved in the criminal activity to report information to DOJ.</p>
                        <p>By offering NPAs to individuals who are engaged in criminal misconduct, the program creates a
                            significant incentive for employees involved in criminal misconduct to be “first in the
                            door” and cooperate against their employer and fellow employees.&nbsp; This incentive may
                            pose challenges for companies conducting internal investigations because interviewing
                            implicated individuals may prompt them to report information to DOJ in an effort to obtain
                            an NPA under the VSD Pilot Program.<a name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7"><span>[7]</span></a></p>
                        <p>Although DOJ traditionally emphasizes individual liability, the Program underscores that
                            there is a heightened focus on corporate liability too, and DOJ is willing to offer an NPA
                            to an individual who can provide original information about high-priority corporate criminal
                            misconduct.</p>
                        <p>The Criminal Division’s announcement follows recent announcements by U.S. Attorneys Offices
                            in the Southern District of New York and the Northern District of California about similar,
                            but not identical, incentives for voluntary disclosures.<a name="_ftnref8"
                                href="#_ftn8"><span>[8]</span></a> &nbsp;This overlap may create questions for
                            individuals about to which part of DOJ to report misconduct, and could create “forum
                            shopping” issues, at least outside of those areas where the Criminal Division has a clear
                            responsibility under DOJ policy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Criteria</strong></p>

                            <li><u>Original Information</u>: The reporting individual “must disclose original
                                information, meaning non-public information not previously known to the Criminal
                                Division or to any component of the Department of Justice[.]” &nbsp;Notably, this
                                appears to require that the individual report the non-public information to the Criminal
                                Division before going to any U.S. Attorney’s Office or other DOJ component.</li>
                            <li><u>Voluntary Disclosure</u>: The disclosure must be voluntary, meaning (1) it must be
                                made prior to any “request, inquiry, or demand that relates to the subject matter of the
                                submission is directed to the individual or anyone representing the individual
                                [(<em>g.</em>, legal representation)] by the [DOJ] in connection with any investigation,
                                or by a federal law enforcement, regulatory, or civil enforcement agency regarding the
                                same misconduct”; (2) there must not be a “preexisting obligation under an agreement in
                                connection with a criminal prosecution or civil enforcement action” to report the
                                information to DOJ or other federal authorities; and (3) the disclosure must be made in
                                the “absence of any government investigation or threat of imminent disclosure to the
                                government or public.”</li>
                            <li><u>Truthful and Complete Disclosure</u>: The disclosure must be “truthful and complete.”
                                &nbsp;This means that the individual must disclose all information that she knows
                                relates to any misconduct in which the individual has participated in and/or of which
                                the individual is aware. &nbsp;The individual must provide truthful and complete answers
                                on “all matters about which the Department may inquire.”</li>
                            <li><u>Cooperation and Substantial Assistance</u>: The Program requires that the individual
                                “fully cooperate” and provide “substantial assistance” in “its investigation of related
                                conduct and prosecution of equally or more culpable individuals or entities.” &nbsp;The
                                policy also defines cooperation as a willingness to produce “documents, records, and
                                other evidence,” as well as to engage in proactive cooperation efforts (<em>g.</em>,
                                wearing a wire) if requested by DOJ.</li>
                            <li><u>Disgorgement/Forfeiture</u>: The “reporting individual must agree to forfeit or
                                disgorge any profit from the criminal wrongdoing and pay restitution or victim
                                compensation.”</li>
                            <li><u>Exclusions</u>: Individuals cannot qualify for the program if they (1) “engaged in
                                criminal conduct involving violence, use of force, threats, substantial patient harm,
                                any sex offense involving fraud, force, or coercion, or relating to a minor, or any
                                offense involving terrorism”; (2) are the “Chief Executive Officer (or equivalent) or
                                Chief Financial Officer (or equivalent) of a public or private company” or “the
                                organizer/leader of the scheme”; (3) are “an elected or appointed foreign government
                                official”; (4) are “a domestic government official at any level, including any employee
                                of a law enforcement agency”; or (5) have “a previous felony conviction or a conviction
                                of any kind for conduct involving fraud or dishonesty.”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Under the VSD Pilot Program, Criminal Division prosecutors will also “retain discretion to
                            offer an NPA to individuals in appropriate circumstances, including where individuals come
                            forward pursuant to the Pilot Program but the criteria above are not met in full.”<a

                        <p><strong>Compliance Considerations</strong></p>
                        <p>The VSD Program is effective immediately, and so potentially impacted companies should
                            consider taking additional compliance-related measures. &nbsp;As we noted regarding the DOJ
                            whistleblower program launched in March, companies should consider the following:<a
                                name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10"><span>[10]</span></a></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Because the DOJ Program will cover a range of potential misconduct, including fraud and
                                bribery, companies should consider reviewing and updating their whistleblowing policies
                                and procedures (or adopting them if needed). These policies and procedures should
                                address the assessment and prompt internal investigation of allegations of misconduct,
                                as well as non-retaliation against whistleblowers (and avenues for whistleblowers to
                                seek recourse in the event there is retaliation).</li>
                            <li>Companies may also wish to consider developing a clear framework for prompt reporting of
                                potential violations internally, and early evaluation of those matters, so that the
                                company will be well-positioned to determine whether, when and how to file a Voluntary
                                Self Disclosure and be “first in the door” to report potential violations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We will monitor developments related to the VSD Pilot Program and similar DOJ programs in the
                            coming months.</p>

                            could be construed to mean that an individual who was the subject of an internal
                            investigation where the company planned to “imminent[ly]” disclose the activity to DOJ may
                            not be eligible.</p>
