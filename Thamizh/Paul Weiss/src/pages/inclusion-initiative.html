            <p>To foster an inclusive environment both internally and externally, the firm is dedicated to offering

            <h3>Internal Inclusion Workshops</h3>
            <p>The firm’s internal diversity, equity and inclusion curriculum is designed to give lawyers at every level
                the tools they need to contribute to creating an inclusive culture for all by being active allies for
                each other and managing matters and teams in an inclusive way.</p>
            <p>For example, the firm offers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Allyship and Interrupting Bias Series:</strong> Interactive workshops for lawyers at all
                    levels designed to describe how bias affects workplace interactions and how to adapt small changes
                    in behavior that make each person a better ally. More than 95% of participants report a “better
                    understanding of how bias affects people as a result of this training.”</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivating Belonging at Work:</strong> A workshop for summer associates on how they can
                    enhance their own and others’ sense of belonging by understanding the power of small inclusive
                    behaviors known as micro-inclusions. Over 90% of participants in the 2020 summer program said they
                    were “likely to implement micro-inclusions in their day-to-day” as a result of the workshop.</li>
                <li><strong>Managing Effectively Across Difference:</strong> A workshop designed to address the unique
                    challenges faced by midlevel associates as they start to lead matters and have to distribute
                    assignments and give feedback to those on their matters.</li>

                    more-effective management skills in general. But it does not end there. Diversity and inclusion
                    should not be viewed as separate and discrete concepts but rather skills required to become the best
                    lawyer possible, because diverse perspectives, experiences, work styles, and so on are embedded into
                    every aspect of firm life.”</h2>

            <h3>Our Certification Recommendations & Requirements</h3>
            <p>To support our supplier diversity program and goals, we maintain a database of hundreds of diverse
                suppliers and consistently add more to our portfolio each year.</p>
            <p>We review businesses that meet the nationally recognized certification standards of at least 51%
                ownership, management and control by a diverse group. Although we have worked with many registered
                diverse suppliers, it is not a requirement to do business with Paul, Weiss.</p>
            <p>Paul, Weiss strongly encourages diverse businesses to pursue certification through one or more certifying
                agencies. Certification gives Paul, Weiss the assurance that businesses claiming a diverse status meet
                the business ownership and management thresholds. We recommend being certified by the Women’s Business
                Enterprise National Council or the National Minority Supplier Development Council, or one of the other
                certification agencies below.</p>
            <p>As part of the firm’s pro bono program, our team may be able to help suppliers with the certification
                process.</p>

            <h3>Paul, Weiss Kids: Book Clubs – Creating Inclusion from the Youngest Ages</h3>
            <p>In 2021, the Paul, Weiss Networks launched the Paul, Weiss Kids Book Clubs to complement the celebration
                of heritage months. For each Book Club meeting, a member of the Network reads a heritage-themed book
                with their child(ren) in front of a virtual audience of Paul, Weiss community members, many attending
                with their own children (who are often vocal participants).</p>
            <p>The Book Clubs bring more conversation about diverse perspectives and experiences into the homes of Paul,
                Weiss community members, allowing families to explore themes related to women’s rights and roles in
                society, Black history and culture, environmental justice, LGBTQ+ pride, Hispanic heritage and
                Asian-Pacific American culture.</p>
            <p>As the Book Clubs bring Paul, Weiss into the home, and the home into Paul, Weiss, our community
                recognizes that diversity, equity and inclusion begins at the youngest ages!</p>
