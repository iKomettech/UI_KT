            <h2>Our Name Partners</h2>
            <p>The stories of the firmâs five name partners are 20th century chronicles with sustaining relevance. They
                include a man who could not find a job as a lawyer for five years after law school and then, while still
                in his forties, became the best known and most influential tax lawyer in the country, after which this
                reserved Welsh Episcopalian became the most vocal inside critic of the U.S. Governmentâs treatment of
                Holocaust victims. A second, a wealthy member of New Yorkâs German Jewish aristocracy, spent much of his
                life defending the poor, the Black, and the mentally ill while building and for a time leading both the
                NAACPâs Legal Committee and the New School of Social Research. Another first stepped on American soil in
                1910 at the age of nine knowing not a syllable of English, a refugee from a Russian shtetl, and at age
                45 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom; served in every branch and at every level of
                government; and was recognized as the finest trial lawyer of his time. A fourth spent a bedridden youth
                reading plays, and sixty years later was given an honorary Tony Award for his contributions to the legal
                foundations of the 20th century American theater, while creating a prodigious output of essays and books
                on economics, political philosophy, and social science. The fifth, deeply rooted in the abolitionist
                movement of the 19th century, became a 20th century leader in civil rights and civil liberties, headed
                the National War Labor Board during World War II, and then defended J. Robert Oppenheimer and Arthur
                Miller from the witch-hunts of the McCarthy era. If, as Emerson said, history is properly biography,
                even a brief summary of these five lives gives a taste of the history of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &
                Garrison.</p>

                            <p><b>Louis Stix Weiss (1927-50),</b> his friend Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, led a âradiant
                                lifeâ as a social reformer, educator and fighter for civil rights. He was born on
                                February 7, 1894 in New York City, the second son and third child of Samuel and Carrie
                                Stix Weiss. He was graduated from the Horace Mann School, earned hisÂ Phi Beta KappaÂ key
                                at Yale College (1915), and, following the war, obtained his law degree from Columbia
                                Law School (1920), where he served on theÂ Columbia Law Review. After a brief association
                                with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, in 1923 he formed Weiss & Wharton with his law school
                                classmate John F. Wharton. Four years later, Louis merged his two-person firm into the
                                practice his father SamÂ had started and his brother William had continued, thereby
                                creating Cohen, Cole, Weiss & Wharton. Weiss and Wharton were together determined to
                                build a firm of substantial character that aggressively disregarded the then-axiomatic
                                circumstance that Jews and Gentiles neither practiced together nor attracted clients of
                                their respective creeds, an endeavor that ultimately transformed the cultural norms of
                                the New York legal community. Weissâs law practice was heavily invested in his
                                relationship with Marshall Field III, scion of the Chicago retailing empire, whose
                                complex personal finances Weiss succeeded in protecting. From these endeavors, Weiss
                                became central to Field Enterprises, the Field Foundation, as well as Fieldâs collateral
                                interests, which included ownership of theÂ Chicago Sun, for which Weiss devised an
                                antitrust assault on the A.P.âs then-exclusionary policies, which the Supreme Court
                                ultimately outlawed inÂ Associated PressÂ v.Â United States, 326 U.S. 1 (1945).

                            <p>Deeply engaged in mental health care issues, Weiss was general counsel of both the
                                American Psychoanalytic Association and the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. A
                                director of the American Council on Race Relations, Weiss also served for years on
                                NAACPâs National Legal Committee, succeeding Thurgood Marshallâs mentor, Howard Law
                                School Dean Charles H. Houston, as its chair. With Eleanor Roosevelt, he was a founding
                                director and vice president of the U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children
                                during World War II, to relocate refugees from that troubled continent. He was a
                                founding trustee of the National Opinion Research Center, still one of the largest and
                                most respected social research centers in the country. He was a longtime trustee and
                                chairman of the board of the New SchoolÂ of Social Research. He was the firmâs prime
                                visionary, persuading his partners to hoard profits as capital for use in attracting
                                talent to build a full-service firm to compete with New Yorkâs finest, and then
                                personally recruiting Paul, Rifkind, and Garrison to join his growing firm. He also
                                convinced them to leave the environs of Wall Street, then headquarters of every
                                significant firm in the city, to open offices in midtown Manhattan, today home to most
                                large law firms. Weiss never made the move from 61 Broadway to 575 Madison Avenue: On
                                November 13, 1950, at age 56, Louis Weiss died suddenly in his New York City home of a
                                heart attack. In theÂ Chicago Defender, then the Nationâs largest and most influential
                                Black weekly, longtime NAACP Executive Secretary Walter White called Weiss âone of a
                                select group to whom whatever freedom Negro Americans and other minorities have won
                                during recent years was due.â</p>
