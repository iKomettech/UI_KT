<h2>Special Categories of Personal Information</h2>
<p>Some data privacy laws, including UK GDPR and GDPR, classify certain categories of personal information as Special Categories of Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may collect special categories of personal information about you for which we act as a data controller when we collect personal information in this manner. Special categories of personal information may include certain demographic information about you such as race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. For example, we may collect information about your race, ethnicity and sexual orientation when you apply for a job with us if you choose to disclose such information. We may also collect information about prior criminal convictions and offences in connection with your application for employment with Paul, Weiss, and other special categories of personal information as part of background checks that we conduct on job applicants and/or clients and as part of providing services on behalf of our clients. If you provide us with, or we collect, any special categories of personal information, or criminal conviction data, on yourself, we will separately ask you for consent before we agree to the processing of such personal information.</p>

<h2>When We Share Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your personal information with others, under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>

<li>We will disclose personal information if you have consented to any disclosure to a third party.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where We Transfer, Use, and Store Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We may transfer, use, or store your personal information outside of your home jurisdiction and, therefore, the laws of some of these destination jurisdictions may not offer the same standard of protection for personal information as your home country.</p>
<p>We currently transfer information to the following jurisdictions: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Economic Area, China, Hong Kong, and Japan.</p>
<p>From time to time, as disclosed above, we may transfer your personal information to our third party service providers. Transfers to our third party service providers are to enable them to use and store your personal information on our behalf. We have in place a program to contractually obligate our third party service providers to offer your personal information an essentially equivalent level of protection as granted by us in this notice.</p>
<p>This program also ensures that, where your information is transferred to any jurisdiction outside of your home country, the transfer is done in compliance with relevant data protection legislation, regulations, and guidelines issued by relevant supervisory authorities. For transfers of personal information outside the UK and the European Economic Area to jurisdictions that do not have an adequacy decision from the European Commission, we ensure that there is a legal basis for this transfer and that we have put in place data transfer agreements that ensure appropriate safeguards are in place so that personal information is treated in a manner that is consistent with, and respects the EU, UK and other applicable laws and regulations relating to data protection. You can request further details by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@paulweiss.com">privacy@paulweiss.com</a>.</p>
<h2>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We will keep your personal information only for as long as necessary depending on the purpose for which it was provided and the periods specified in relation to the relevant system in our data protection policies.</p>
<p>When determining how long we will keep your personal information, we will take into account various factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal obligations under applicable law to retain data for a certain period of time;</li>
<li>Statute of limitations under applicable law(s);</li>
<li>Status of ongoing legal engagements;</li>
<li>Your withdrawal of consent (where applicable);</li>
<li>Potential disputes; and</li>
<li>Guidelines issued by relevant supervisory authorities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We have put in place measures to protect the security of your personal information.</p>
<p>These measures are intended to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, altered, disclosed, or used or accessed in an unauthorized way. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to only those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via email is not secure. Therefore, if you use email for communicating with us, we cannot guarantee that it will remain confidential while in transit.</p>
<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, and subject to legal conditions, you may have the right to object to the processing of your personal information, to request a copy of the personal information about you which we hold, to request cessation of sharing of personal information with third parties, or to request correction, cessation of use, or erasure of such personal information. For example, if you are a resident of California, you have the right to take these actions without fear of any discriminatory treatment pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom you have a right to take these actions at any time and will not be charged any fee. You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>While you will usually not have to pay a fee to exercise these rights, in some cases, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive, or if you request multiple copies of the same information. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information or to exercise any of your other rights.</p>
<p>Please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@paulweiss.com">privacy@paulweiss.com</a> or <a href="tel:800-656-8418">800-656-8418</a> if you wish to exercise any of these rights, if you wish to designate an authorized agent to exercise any of these rights on your behalf, if you wish to request further information about any of the above rights, or if you are unhappy with how we have handled your personal information. We will respond to your inquiry within the timeframes required by applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with our response or believe our processing of your information does not comply with data protection law, you can make a complaint to the relevant supervisory authority.
