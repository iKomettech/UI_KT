                    <p>When associates join the Corporate Department as first-years, we prepare them for a strong start,
                        beginning with our substantive and hands-on programs at New Associate Orientation. From there,
                        junior associates participate in our practice group-specific trainings taught by partners,
                        counsel and associates with whom they work. These comprehensive department-specific curricula
                        include substantive training on legal and business topics, skills-based training and individual
                        coaching. In addition to these rotation-specific trainings, junior associates will also
                        participate in a skills-based bootcamp during their second year. Over three half-day sessions,
                        the bootcamp covers best practices, collaboration across practice groups, deal management and
                        career insights from partners. Features include interactive small group discussions, panels, a
                        negotiations workshop with feedback sessions led by partners, and a financial statements
                        refresher. Midlevel and more senior associates attend tailored programs and experiential
                        workshops in their particular practice areas.</p>

                        rule; to bring free Shakespeare to Central Park by overcoming Robert Moses’s efforts to stop it;
                        to resist the death penalty by defending scores condemned to die and obtaining a historic
                        victory in the U.S. Supreme Court forbidding execution of the mentally disabled; to protect a
                        woman’s right to choose by fighting attacks on Roe v. Wade; to introduce educational public

                        gays and lesbians to marry; to promote sane and stricter gun control legislation; and to save
