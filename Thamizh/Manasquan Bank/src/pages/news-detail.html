            <p> <strong> WALL TOWNSHIP, NJ (July 15, 2021) </strong>– The Manasquan Bank Charitable Foundation, an
                affiliate of Manasquan Bank, brought 18 local organizations together for its second quarterly Charitable
                Foundation meeting of 2021. The grant recipient event was a chance for community members to learn more
                about Manasquan Bank’s philosophy for its future success and commitment to its community-based partners.
                It was also a great opportunity for each organization receiving a foundation grant to tell their story
                and explain how the new grant will assist in the achievement of their overall mission.
            </p>


            <p>Manasquan Bank Chairman, President and CEO, James S. Vaccaro, along with the Foundation’s trustees kicked
                off the morning’s event, where they provided an overview of the mission and strategic efforts of the
                Bank and its Foundation. “Charitable giving has been central to the core values of Manasquan Bank since
                its very beginnings,” said Vaccaro. “We recognize those who share our passion for building a better
                community and we are privileged to provide them with financial assistance”.</p>


            <p>Notably, at the recipient event, those receiving an annual grant from the foundation included Mental
                Health Association of Monmouth County, Stop Drowning Now, Monmouth Arts, Collier Youth Services, Family
                Promise of Southern Ocean County, YMCA of Metuchen, Edison, Woodbridge and South Amboy, Community
                Nursery School, Arc of Monmouth County, Bayshore Center at Bivalve, Tigger House Foundation, InfoAge
                Science and History Museum, Interfaith Health & Support Services of Southern Ocean County, Inc., The
                Valerie Fund, Fighting H.A.R.D Foundation, Association for Multiple Impaired Blind (AMIB), Visiting
                Nurse Association of Central NJ, Autism Family Services of NJ, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Coastal
                and Northern NJ.</p>


            <p>Many Americans who skip breakfast say it’s because they’re too busy taking their kids to school or
                commute
                to work and don’t have time to stop and eat. DeRobertis recommends several ways to fit a healthy
                breakfast
                into a busy schedule:</p>

            <p>In addition to the quarterly Foundation meetings, Manasquan Bank will begin hosting town hall-style
                meetings for its existing clients, as well as potential business clients, each month after hours at a
                rotating branch location. Additional event details are forthcoming.</p>
