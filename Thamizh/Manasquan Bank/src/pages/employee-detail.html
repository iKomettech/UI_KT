            <p>For Mark Beriault and his team of 37 commercial lending staff it&rsquo;s all about people versus numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sheer size of today&rsquo;s national banks dictates interest in only big deals. If a loan request is not a number with at least six zeroes, it receives little if any interest,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Beriault is speaking from experience. His banking career began 37 years ago with a regional bank that, through a series of mergers and acquisitions, ultimately became Bank of America. &ldquo;With each name change, we saw more centralized decision making and less customer service,&rdquo; he recalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Manasquan Bank, the size of the loan request is secondary to the business owner or property owner making the request,&rdquo; says Mark Beriault, Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer, who oversees all residential and business loans for the Bank.</p>
<p>Beriault joined the Bank in 2004 to expand its lending operations. He has assembled a team of seasoned local loan officers that contact borrowers personally and make informed decisions in a timely manner. &ldquo;We typically get back to the applicant with a decision within two to three weeks,&rdquo; he states.</p>
<p>Beriault&rsquo;s team is nimble and customer service oriented. &ldquo;We can afford to be, because all loan decisions are made right here. It also means we can service the loan more efficiently. If a business or property owner has a question, he or she calls the account officer directly. Our customers don&rsquo;t need a toll free number and an afternoon to spend on hold,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Beriault knows that a significant portion of Manasquan Bank&rsquo;s business loans have been taken from multi-billion dollar institutions. &ldquo;Servicing is the issue. When decisions are moved from local loan officers to out-of-state analysts, the customer suffers. We succeed because we give business owners prompt answers to their questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Farmingdale resident states the rest of Manasquan&rsquo;s commercial loans come from long-term customers. For example, we have a coffee manufacturer who started with a small line of credit. A few years later, we financed the purchase of his building. Now he has multiple Real Estate holdings, a working capital line of credit, an equipment line of credit, and five buildings. We&rsquo;ve grown together,&rdquo; says Mark who adds that relationships like this remind him why he enjoys working at Manasquan Bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that I can make a difference every day,&rdquo; he says, noting that Manasquan Bank has been heavily involved in financing much of the rebuilding related to Hurricane Sandy. &ldquo;We offer a construction loan that only charges interest on funds drawn. Once building is complete it converts to a conventional mortgage,&rdquo; he explains.</p>
<p>Beriault notes that while it simplifies the rebuilding process and eliminates duplicate closing costs, construction loans are much more labor intensive for the lender. &ldquo;Other area banks shy away from construction loans because of the added paperwork. We do it because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;What I do matters,&rdquo; he concludes.</p>
