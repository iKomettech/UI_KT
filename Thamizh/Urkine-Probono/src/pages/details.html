                    Parole is neither a visa nor refugee status. For people who may otherwise be ineligible to enter the
                    United States (e.g., unable to get a visa), parole is permission to remain in the United States for
                    a
                    temporary period because of a compelling emergency, urgent humanitarian reason, or significant
                    public
                    benefit. Parole requests for these reasons are often called Humanitarian Parole.
